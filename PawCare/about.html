<!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
<section>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>
PawCare Foundation is a non-profit animal welfare organization dedicated to
rescuing abandoned, injured, and homeless dogs. Founded with compassion and
commitment, we work towards creating a safer and kinder environment for animals.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
Our mission is to rescue animals in distress, provide them with proper medical
care, and ensure they find loving and responsible homes. We also aim to spread
awareness about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>
We envision a society where no animal is left to suffer on the streets and every
pet is treated with dignity, love, and care. Through education and community
involvement, we strive to reduce animal cruelty and abandonment.
</p>

<h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
<p>
Unlike many shelters, PawCare Foundation focuses on rehabilitation and emotional
healing of rescued dogs. Each animal receives individual attention, medical
support, and behavioral care before adoption.
